# what if i wish to share this calculator with my friends
# we need to write these lines on a file
# lets run this file using "python var_op.py"
# there is no output ... what's wrong ??
# when writing on file, we need to tell python whether we wish to see the output or not 

print(5+2)
print(5-2)
print(5*2)
print(5**2)
print(5/2)
print(5.0/2)
print(5.0//2)
print(5%2)

# now what if i want to do these operations with 3 and 4
# and then with 12453 and 738383......will you change the numbers on each line?
# and that too, every time? ... tedious right?
# then lets introduce variables to ease it out

a = 5
b = 2

print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a**b)
print(a/b)
print(a//b)
print(a%b)

# now, just change the values at one place, it will change everywhere
# but the way its printed doesnt seem very nice, right?
# lets move on to our next module and find out some solution
